# Script and function to demonstrate the use of CFFI

CFFI can be used to compile C code into libraries that are readable with python.

The advantage to CFFI over CTypes is that with CFFI you do not need to do any special preperations to your inputs that you need to do with CTypes.

See the python notebook in the examples directory for a quick demonstration
